# dotfiles

These are my custom dotfiles, taking inspiration from many different places.

# Usage

My dotfiles are managed using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/drewnix/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
stow zsh # ...and whatever else you want
```

or to install all safely ...

```bash
git clone https://github.com/drewnix/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
./dotfiles.sh
```
